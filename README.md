# ðŸ§  Limit Order Book Price Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict **short-term price movements** using **limit order book (LOB)** data.  
It focuses on high-frequency trading (HFT) signals and market microstructure analysis by extracting features like **spread**, **mid-price**, and **bid/ask levels**, then using a **Random Forest classifier** to forecast future price direction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
> Can a machine learning model predict whether the **mid-price** will go up or down after a few steps using just order book data?
